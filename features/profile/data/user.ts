Hello, World! I am Chauhan Yuvraj — a Software Engineer passionate about creating clean, high-performance, and user-centric software solutions.


With hands-on experience spanning full-stack development, I specialize in building robust web and mobile applications using React, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript. I thrive on turning complex requirements into functional, scalable products, whether for disaster management systems with the Indian Army or for fast-paced hackathon challenges. Beyond my academic and professional work, I love bringing ideas to life through personal projects.

One of my standout projects is an AI-driven chatbot developed for the SSIP 2023 Hackathon. Using the MERN stack, I engineered a solution that streamlined access to medical equipment data, reducing information retrieval time by 30% and boosting user satisfaction by 25%.

I also created [expo-router-redux-nativewind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-template-redux-nativewind), a modern, lightweight template designed to supercharge project scaffolding for developers using Expo, Redux, and NativeWind. It’s a clean, production-ready foundation that saves hours of setup time.

Let's connect and collaborate!
